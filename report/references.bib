  abstract  = {This paper is a preliminary to a detailed survey of the relative powers of a number of omnibus and directional tests of nonnormality. The probability integrals of √ b1 and b2, the standardized third and fourth moment statistics, are found for random samples from a normal distribution. Main attention is given to b2. Extensive computer simulation and curve fitting have been used to provide charts of probability levels out to the 0.1% point, for 20 ⩽ n ⩽ 200. For √ b1, the parameters of Johnson's symmetrical SU approximation are tabled for values of n between 8 and 1000. An illustration is given of two `omnibus' tests applying the charts and table, involving the joint use of √ b1 and b2.},
